Opener - 
	The human race has done so much since the year 2055. We have developed interplanetary travel, established several colonies on many different planets throughout our 
galaxy, and have succesfully come together as a people to form the Earth Alliance. Everything for the species was going wonderfully, until we found it. Something that
our scientists had deamed impossible.In 2175, one of our explorer teams came across what looked like a tear in space. It was as if God himself took space in his hands and
ripped a whole in the fabric. As of now this 'ripspace' supposedly was a gateway to another universe, but thats the extent to our knowledge. My job is to enter the Ripspace,
risk the lives of my team, and establish a comunication network to bring information back to the EA.





	Mission 1 - Gather your team, get ready to enter into the unknown.
