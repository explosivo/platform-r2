rip off of explorers guild

easily moddable... so weapon/ability/sprite file loading?

mindless, infinite enemies running in, you kill them,
character leveling, earn abilities/upgrades, enemies get harder, 
maybe progress through game levels - some set formula for increasing difficulty with prompt..
eh or with each increased character level the environment changes in some formulated way
no level cap

save feature? meh.

make an arena game, continue updating the arena play until it's pretty awesome
evolve the arena into combat in an rpg with some plot line
keep arena as a game mode
eventually add pvp/multiplayer.. or not.. idk
