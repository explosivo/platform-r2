16 bit looking graphics



rip off of explorers guild

easily moddable... so weapon/ability/sprite file loading?

mindless, infinite enemies running in, you kill them,
character leveling, earn abilities/upgrades, enemies get harder, 
maybe progress through game levels - some set formula for increasing difficulty with prompt..
eh or with each increased character level the environment changes in some formulated way
no level cap

save feature? meh.

make an arena game, continue updating the arena play until it's pretty awesome
evolve the arena into combat in an rpg with some plot line
keep arena as a game mode
eventually add pvp/multiplayer.. or not.. idk


--------4/01/13--------
Level.java so far is level prototype
Level will contain static objects (player, etc)
levels will extends Level and transition between each other seamlessly

Cutscenes will be animated in Flash with png/jpg export per frame
using game sprites as symbols

a Level instance will become active when intersected by Player
monsters will respawn- needing spawn animation
unlike the current mechanic-
	dead monsters in a room will stay dead until the second re-entry

*maybe monsters will continue to spawn from some object in the room
	like an air-duct or something, until destroyed by Player
	
Add level ups for monsters too, Player levels up- Monsters get more difficult


*****Story*****
you wake up in a cell inside a spaceship.
An NPC informs you that he has secured
the cell from outside entry.  Apparently,
an experiment malfunctioned in platform-r2
on board the ship, infecting the crew- turning
them into many nasty things.  The NPC has fitted
fitted you with a LaserTool, it goes on your wrist
and serves multiple purposes, perhaps most
important- killing monsters. There are chips left 
lying around to upgrade the tool.  Because you
are the only one brave enough, you must journey
to platform-r2 and bring everything back to normal

--------4/02/13--------
add methods to Level, setting(), stage(), above()
for a more organized rendering as things are getting less static
